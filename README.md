# 2048-midterm
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. 
It was actually written by Italian web-developer Gabriele Cirulli. 

The main purpose of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 
The rules are very easy! You just need to move the tiles(by typing w-up,s-down,a-left,d-right) and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box. When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially.
